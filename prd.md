Project Title:

Sales Call Transcript Analysis and Insight Generation (POC)

Overview:

This Proof-of-Concept aims to demonstrate a scalable, affordable, and effective method for analyzing and extracting actionable insights from sales call transcripts. It leverages advanced NLP techniques and large language models (GPT-4 and GPT-3.5) to identify call success factors, customer objections, agent performance trends, and hidden patterns.

Objectives:

Demonstrate the ability to generate qualitative insights using GPT-4.

Show cost-effective bulk tagging and quantitative insights using GPT-3.5.

Provide a scalable framework suitable for datasets beyond 4,000 calls.

Scope:

Analyze an initial dataset of 100 call transcripts for the POC.

Embed calls using OpenAI's embedding API.

Categorize calls using GPT-4 for detailed analysis (small sample).

Categorize bulk calls efficiently using GPT-3.5.

Conduct exploratory analysis to identify unknown patterns.




Non-fixed (open to change) step-by-step template:

Here‚Äôs your step-by-step guide to quickly build the **simple proof-of-concept (POC)** right away. Simply, and practically.

## ‚úÖ **Goal of This Simple POC**:

* Take **50‚Äì100 call transcripts**.
* Embed them with OpenAI.
* Tag them simply using GPT-4.
* Perform basic exploratory analysis for immediate insights.

---

## üö© **Step 1: Prepare Your Data (50‚Äì100 calls)**

**Action:**

* Choose **50‚Äì100 call transcripts** from your campaign data.
* Ideally, these transcripts should be short (around 1 minute each) for simplicity.

**Format:**

* Store them as individual `.txt` files or one large CSV/Excel with one transcript per row.

Example format (CSV):

| `call_id` | `transcript`                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| call\_001 | "Hello, I'm calling from..."    |
| call\_002 | "Good afternoon, my name is..." |
| ...       | ...                             |

---

## üö© **Step 2: Generate Embeddings with OpenAI**

**Why:**

* Embeddings enable semantic similarity and fast retrieval.

**Exactly how:**

Use **Python** for simplicity.

**Install OpenAI first**:

```bash
pip install openai pandas
```

### üêç **Python Example (very simple):**

```python
import openai
import pandas as pd

openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# Load your transcripts
df = pd.read_csv('calls.csv')

# Simple function to embed a single call
def get_embedding(text):
    response = openai.Embedding.create(
        model="text-embedding-3-small",  # cheaper, good enough
        input=text
    )
    return response['data'][0]['embedding']

# Generate embeddings for all calls
df['embedding'] = df['transcript'].apply(get_embedding)

# Save embeddings
df.to_csv('calls_with_embeddings.csv', index=False)
```

**Cost**:

* Extremely cheap (around \$1 or less for 100 calls).

---

## üö© **Step 3: Simple Tagging Using GPT-4**

You'll quickly categorize each call into relevant groups.

**Simple tagging categories:**

* Relevant ‚Äì Success
* Relevant ‚Äì Failed but interested
* Relevant ‚Äì Failed not interested
* Relevant ‚Äì Failed saturated with customers
* Not Relevant (no useful conversation)

### üêç **Python Example (easy & clear):**

```python
import openai
import pandas as pd

openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

df = pd.read_csv('calls_with_embeddings.csv')

def tag_call(transcript):
    prompt = f"""
    Categorize the following sales call transcript into exactly one of these categories:
    1. Relevant - Success
    2. Relevant - Failed but interested
    3. Relevant - Failed not interested
    4. Relevant - Failed saturated with customers
    5. Not Relevant (no useful conversation)

    Transcript:
    {transcript}

    Only reply with the exact category name.
    """
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0
    )
    category = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
    return category

# Tag all calls
df['category'] = df['transcript'].apply(tag_call)

# Save results
df.to_csv('calls_tagged.csv', index=False)
```

**Cost**:

* Around \$1 total (for 100 calls).

---

## üö© **Step 4: Perform Exploratory GPT-4 Analysis for Insights**

Now let's discover quick insights automatically.

### üêç **Python Example (easy exploratory insights)**:

```python
import openai
import pandas as pd

openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

df = pd.read_csv('calls_tagged.csv')

# Sample (if dataset large)
sample_transcripts = "\n\n".join(df['transcript'].head(100))

prompt = f"""
You're an expert sales analyst. Review these sales call transcripts and identify:
1. The most common reasons calls fail.
2. Common customer objections.
3. Any notable patterns or unusual interactions between agents and customers.

Transcripts:
{sample_transcripts}

Provide your analysis clearly as bullet points.
"""

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    temperature=0.3
)

insights = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()

# Output insights clearly
print("üîç Exploratory Analysis Insights:\n")
print(insights)
```

**Cost**:

* Around \$2‚Äì\$3 total (for 100 calls).

---

## üö© **Step 5: Easily Summarize Results for Internal Demo**

Summarize clearly for your team (using Excel/Google Sheets).

Simple Excel Sheet columns:

| call\_id  | category           | insights        |
| --------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| call\_001 | Relevant - Success | (insights here) |
| call\_002 | Not Relevant       | (insights here) |
| ...       | ...                | ...             |

Then add a simple section summarizing exploratory insights (the bullet points GPT-4 provided).

## üö© **Total Realistic Costs & Effort (for your simple POC)**

| Task                       | Time Needed     | Cost (realistic) |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Prepare transcripts        | \~1 hour        | \$0 ‚úÖ            |
| Generate embeddings        | \~20 minutes    | \$1 total ‚úÖ      |
| Simple GPT-4 tagging       | \~30‚Äì60 mins    | \$1 total ‚úÖ      |
| Exploratory GPT-4 analysis | \~20 minutes    | \$2‚Äì3 total ‚úÖ    |
| Summarize insights         | \~30 minutes    | \$0 ‚úÖ            |
| **Total**                  | \~3 hours total | \~\$5 total ‚úÖ    |

## üö© **What You'll Have at the End of Today:**

* **Clear structured data**: transcripts tagged and embedded.
* **Immediate practical insights**: common call-failure reasons, patterns, and customer objections clearly summarized.
* **Simple proof-of-concept**: quickly demonstrable to your manager/team.

---

## üéØ **Exactly What to Do Right Now (Summary Recap)**

‚úÖ **Immediately (right now)**:

* Prepare transcripts (CSV).

‚úÖ **Today**:

* Embed calls ‚Üí tag with GPT ‚Üí exploratory analysis (3 quick scripts above).

‚úÖ **Tomorrow Morning**:

* Show clearly summarized results internally as proof-of-value.
* Easily scale this approach up incrementally as you add more calls.

---

## üö© **Next Steps after Successful Simple POC:**

* **Scale incrementally**: repeat embedding and tagging weekly/monthly.
* Set up dashboards or Custom GPT chatbot later to improve insights continuously.
* Add automated exploratory analysis monthly to proactively discover new insights.
