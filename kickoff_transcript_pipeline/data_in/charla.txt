[00:00] Speaker A: Hi everyone, appreciate you joining.
[00:05] Speaker B: Great, let's go over the agenda.
[00:12] Speaker A: We'll first align on modules and pricing for the product.
[00:18] Speaker B: After that, rollout details, SLAs, and next actions.
[00:25] Speaker A: Recording is on; timestamps are visible.
[00:33] Speaker B: Right, and we also collected another transcript.
[00:40] Speaker A: Krisp tends to be cleaner; Teams provides actual names.
[00:48] Speaker B: Charla helps complete fragments when needed.
[00:55] Speaker A: Exactly.
[01:02] Speaker A: The product includes onboarding automation, analytics, and compliance logging.
[01:09] Speaker B: Analytics covers cohort retention and funnel metrics.
[01:16] Speaker A: Compliance logging captures access and export events.
[01:22] Speaker B: We'll map generic speakers to real names using Teams.
[01:29] Speaker A: Collapse repeated words like yeah yeah.
[01:36] Speaker B: Remove short fillers up to three tokens.
[01:42] Speaker A: Anything with low confidence under 0.5 goes to QA notes.
[01:49] Speaker B: DOCX should have fiveâ€‘minute chapter headings.
[01:56] Speaker A: Sounds good.
[02:03] Speaker B: Let's start a pilot rollout next week.
[02:10] Speaker A: We'll confirm after checking the fusion results.
