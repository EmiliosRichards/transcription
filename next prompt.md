I want to use, maybe for this analysis, what we need to have a max of maybe 25 calls. But we need to figure out a way of correctly bunching them or bundling them. If we have some phone calls that are longer, how might we handle that? Maybe we put the longer ones together so that in the LLM calls for analysis, we don't have high standard deviations in terms of recording total numbers or total number of recordings. So maybe all of the phone numbers that had many recordings, they're grouped together with a max of like a max context, maybe 25 calls. Maybe 25 calls is too much, maybe 15 or 20 calls worth. If a call is just, yeah, half, like 30 seconds or half a minute, one minute, maybe we should think of a token count. Maybe we need to think of a better way of doing this, but then just like call number, maybe we should just pick a token amount and we need to make sure, like maybe a token range, because like maybe we'll have an LLM sum up three or four multiple call customers. And then in some other batches, we'll have an LLM sum up 15 customers all with just one call each. Do you know what I mean? That way, we're also aggregating things that are alike to one another. And that might help in the final analysis. And I guess in the final analysis, we need to make it aware of the fact that there'll be different viewpoints from each bunch, and it needs to take into account all of these, and it shouldn't wash over information, but it has to try to do its best to give a sort of ratio, sort of like a balance, a deep analysis on it. Maybe it can count how many good, how many bad, and it can return some statistics as well. What do you think? Because statistics are quite important in this, like how many had good responses, how many bad responses, et cetera. But for this exploratory analysis, maybe the statistical thing is a completely different prompt. Maybe we can do that separately. That would be cool too. So maybe we have two systems, one for statistical, one for maybe like deeper questions such as like the exploratory analysis. Take a look at the MD file that I included in the root of the directory. It's called batchingidea.md.


i want to address an issue I saw with the transcriptions of a certain audio file @Recording ID: PR_4656ab3d-f66b-6b64-e081-612c4d8e8ecc


The following text disscussion explains the situation.

---discussion---

prompt: 
so just want to talk about something we noticed when testing the first audio file. The german speaker got back to me and brought to my attention that a certain audio clip at the end finishes with the agent and customer arranging to send an email. But the transcripts, for every model, be that gpt transcribe gpt mini, whisper api or whisper oss, all of them had this line at then end, strangely: Yes, then please don't call again. Thank you, bye. This is never said by the speakers in the audio, what could cause such a big error across all of the models?

response:
Short version: this is a classic ASR “hallucination at the tail.” It happens when models hit very low-signal audio (silence, hiss, music) and the language model completes a *plausible* call-center goodbye. If all models did it, they were likely seeing the same cues.

**Common triggers**

* **Trailing silence / low SNR** → VAD/endpointer thinks there’s still speech, LM fills in a generic close (“thanks, bye”).
* **Chunking with context carryover** → decoder conditions on previous text and keeps “finishing the story.”
* **Wrong mode or language** (e.g., translate instead of transcribe, not forcing `language=de`) can increase drift.
* **Sample-rate / channel quirks** → quiet second channel, DC offset, or resampling noise fools VAD.
* **Temperature / decoding** above zero, or no confidence gating → easy to accept a low-confidence final segment.

**Quick checks**

1. Re-encode: `ffmpeg -i in.mp3 -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le clean.wav` and re-run.
2. Trim tail: transcribe just the **last 15–20s**; if the line still appears, it’s the tail.
3. Force German + transcription (not translation).
4. For Whisper (local): set `temperature=0`, `vad_filter=true`, and try `condition_on_previous_text=false`.
5. Inspect confidences (Whisper `verbose_json`: `avg_logprob`, `no_speech_prob`). If last segment is low-conf/high-no-speech → drop it.

**Mitigations to ship**

* Preprocess audio: VAD/silence trimming on the tail (e.g., WebRTC VAD or `silenceremove` in ffmpeg).
* Deterministic decoding (temp=0) + language forced.
* Post-filter: reject final segments with low confidence or that fail forced alignment (WhisperX/stable-ts).
* If you must keep 4o Transcribe/Mini, do the VAD/trim step yourself since they don’t expose confidence fields.

If you want, I can wire a small “tail guard” into the pipeline: trim trailing silence, run transcribe, and drop any last segment that isn’t supported by alignment/confidence — that should eliminate this kind of fabricated goodbye.


Prompt:  the part where it says please dont call again could also be fabricated ?

Response:
Yes—100%. That “please don’t call again” line can be entirely fabricated. End-of-call hallucinations are common: the model hits low signal (silence/hiss/music), leans on its call-center priors, and “completes” a plausible goodbye (e.g., *Danke, tschüss / Thank you, bye / please don’t call again*), even if no one said it.

Why it happens (quickly):

* trailing silence or bad VAD → decoder thinks there’s still speech and autocompletes,
* conditioning on previous text → it “finishes the story,”
* wrong/loose settings (no forced language, temp > 0), or resampling quirks.

How to prevent it:

* trim/guard the tail (VAD or `ffmpeg silenceremove`) before transcription,
* decode deterministically (temperature=0) and force `language=de`,
* post-check the final segment: low confidence / poor alignment ⇒ drop it (WhisperX/stable-ts),
  or implement a simple “tail guard” that rejects last lines with no acoustic evidence.

If you’d like, I can add that tail-guard step to your pipeline so these fabricated goodbyes get filtered out.

---end of discussion---


Now with this discussion as context, I would like to do some testing to see if we can account for hallucinations as discribed. I want to do this in a way that does not go and change tons of code, or change what we have built so far. if we are just adjusting settings on one model at a time, then this is good and fine, if we are making big code changes, I would like to back up and what not, so as to not lose progress if we make mistakes or changes we dont want to keep .
