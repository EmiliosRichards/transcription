[00:00] Speaker 1: Hello everyone, thanks for joining today.
[00:05] Speaker 2: Thanks, let's begin with the agenda.
[00:12] Speaker 1: First we align on product modules and pricing.
[00:18] Speaker 2: Then we cover rollout, SLAs, and next steps.
[00:25] Speaker 1: The recording is active and timestamps should be visible.
[00:33] Speaker 2: Yes, and we also have the Charla transcript.
[00:40] Speaker 1: The Krisp text is usually cleaner, while Teams has names.
[00:48] Speaker 2: Charla can help fill gaps if a line is cut.
[00:55] Speaker 1: Exactly.
[01:02] Speaker 1: Our product covers onboarding automation, analytics, and compliance logging.
[01:09] Speaker 2: The analytics module includes cohort retention and funnel analysis.
[01:16] Speaker 1: Compliance logging tracks access and exports.
[01:22] Speaker 2: We'll map Speaker 1/2 to real names from Teams.
[01:29] Speaker 1: Duplicate words like yeah yeah should be collapsed.
[01:36] Speaker 2: Short fillers of up to three tokens should be removed.
[01:42] Speaker 1: Lines with confidence below zero point five belong in QA.
[01:49] Speaker 2: DOCX export should include headings every five minutes.
[01:56] Speaker 1: Sounds good.
[02:03] Speaker 2: For rollout, we can start with a pilot next week.
[02:10] Speaker 1: Agreed. Let's finalize after reviewing the fusion output.
