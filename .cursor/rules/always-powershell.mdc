description: Enforce that all CLI commands are provided in PowerShell syntax.
alwaysApply: true
---

- Always provide CLI commands and scripts in PowerShell (Windows PowerShell/PowerShell 7) syntax.
- Prefer native PowerShell cmdlets over Unix utilities:
  - Invoke-RestMethod instead of curl
  - Get-Content/Set-Content/Out-File instead of cat/touch/tee/redirection
  - Select-String instead of grep
  - Expand-Archive/Compress-Archive instead of tar/zip
- Use PowerShell quoting and interpolation rules: single quotes for literals, double quotes for interpolation, and $(...) for sub-expressions.
- For inline Python snippets, wrap the code in a PowerShell here-string and pipe it to Python via stdin (no Bash heredocs). Example:

```powershell
$pythonScript = @'
print("Hello from PowerShell here-string via stdin")
'@
$pythonScript | python -
```

- Avoid Bash-only syntax (e.g., heredocs, && with Bash semantics, export). If chaining is needed, use PowerShell pipelines or separate statements.
